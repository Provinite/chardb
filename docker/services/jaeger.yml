# Jaeger Distributed Tracing Service
#
# All-in-one Jaeger deployment for distributed tracing and observability.
# Provides essential debugging and performance monitoring capabilities:
# - Trace collection from the backend API via OpenTelemetry
# - Request flow visualization across service boundaries
# - Performance bottleneck identification
# - Error tracking and debugging assistance
# - Service dependency mapping
# - Latency analysis and optimization insights
#
# Web UI available at http://localhost:16686 for trace visualization.
# Accepts traces from the OTEL collector in multiple formats (OTLP, Zipkin).
# Essential for understanding application behavior and debugging issues.
