- [x] **Docker Observability Stack**: Complete containerized tracing infrastructure
- [x] **Performance Optimization**: CORS caching (24hr) and request lifecycle visibility
- [x] **React App Stability**: Fixed React bundling errors and "Invalid hook call" issues
- [x] **GraphQL Context Handling**: Custom throttler guard properly handles GraphQL vs HTTP contexts
- [x] **Firefox Parallel Request Limiting**: Vite optimizations to prevent overwhelming parallel requests

**Key Features**:
- 🔍 **Real-time Tracing**: Complete request lifecycle visibility from HTTP to database queries
- 🐌 **Performance Monitoring**: Automatic detection and alerting for slow requests (>1000ms)
- 🌐 **CORS Debugging**: Special tracking for OPTIONS preflight requests and timing
- 📊 **Visual Analysis**: Jaeger UI for trace search, filtering, and bottleneck identification
- ⚡ **Non-invasive**: Auto-instrumentation requiring no business logic changes
- 🛡️ **Production Ready**: Memory limiting, batching, and graceful shutdown handling
- 🛠️ **Application Stability**: Resolved React rendering issues and GraphQL throttling conflicts

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// OpenTelemetry Stack
- NodeSDK with auto-instrumentations for HTTP, Express, GraphQL
- OTLP exporters with gRPC/HTTP protocols for reliable trace delivery
- Custom TracingMiddleware for request timing and metadata collection
- Resource attribution with service name, version, environment

// Infrastructure Components  
- Jaeger all-in-one (ports: 16686 UI, 4317/4318 OTLP, 14250/14268 collectors)
- OTEL Collector with memory limiting, batching, and multi-export pipelines
- Health check endpoints (/health, /health/tracing) for monitoring
- Docker services with proper dependencies and health checks

// Stability Fixes
- CustomThrottlerGuard: GraphQL-aware throttling with context type detection
- Vite Configuration: Dependency pre-bundling and connection limiting (maxSockets: 5)
- React Compatibility: Removed problematic manual chunking causing multiple React instances
```

**Observability Endpoints**:
- ✅ **Jaeger UI**: http://localhost:16686 - Visual trace analysis and search
- ✅ **Health Check**: http://localhost:4000/health - Service status and tracing config
- ✅ **Tracing Test**: http://localhost:4000/health/tracing - Generate test spans
- ✅ **Metrics**: http://localhost:8889/metrics - Prometheus metrics from collector

**Performance Optimizations**:
- ✅ **CORS Preflight Caching**: 24-hour maxAge for reduced OPTIONS request frequency
- ✅ **Firefox Request Limiting**: Vite maxSockets configuration prevents overwhelming parallel requests
- ✅ **Dependency Pre-bundling**: React, Apollo, styled-components pre-bundled for faster startup
- ✅ **Throttling Intelligence**: GraphQL requests skip HTTP-focused throttling to prevent context errors

**Fun Fact**: The original "2-second CORS delay" that triggered this implementation turned out to be adblock! 🤦‍♂️ But now we have enterprise-grade observability for future debugging and stable React app rendering.
