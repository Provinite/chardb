## Notes for Test Execution

1. **Database State:** These tests assume a clean or well-known database state. Some workflows may need existing test data.

2. **Browser Compatibility:** Test primarily in a modern browser (Chrome/Firefox). Cross-browser testing can be secondary.

3. **Performance:** Note any significant performance issues, especially with media uploads and large content listings.

4. **Page Refresh Testing:** Always test page refresh stability (F5) after creating/editing content to verify data persistence and prevent GraphQL serialization issues.

5. **Console Monitoring:** Keep browser console open during testing. Look for errors and warnings.

6. **Field Rendering Validation:** After any backend schema changes, verify ALL fields render correctly on character detail pages, especially:
   - Species/speciesVariant relationships
   - JSON fields (customFields, traitValues)
   - Computed fields (likesCount, media counts)
   - Date fields and formatting

## Test Data Management

### Required Test Data

- Test user account (test@example.com / password123)
- Sample images for upload testing (various formats and sizes)
- Test character data with various field combinations
- Sample text content for testing

### Data Cleanup

After testing, consider cleaning up test data to avoid database bloat, or maintain dedicated test datasets for consistent testing.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Type Safety Issues

**Problem:** `Promise<any>` return types masking errors
**Solution:** Use specific entity types like `Promise<CharacterEntity>` for better compile-time checking
