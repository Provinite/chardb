#### TypeScript Type Safety Improvements

- Proper TypeScript interfaces for nested GraphQL entity fields (`owner`, `image`, `textContent`)
- Enhanced type safety for media component props with strict typing
- Eliminated `any` type usage in media components to prevent runtime type errors

### Fixed

#### Media Gallery Issues

- **Media Type Filter Button Visibility (#12)**: Fixed filter buttons disappearing when no content exists for selected type
  - Root cause: Filter counts calculated from filtered results instead of total dataset
  - Solution: Separate GraphQL queries for display data vs. count data
  - Result: Filter buttons remain visible showing accurate counts (e.g., "Images (2)", "Text (0)")
- **Incorrect Media Type Counts**: Fixed media type counts showing as 0 despite having content
  - Frontend now uses backend-provided `imageCount` and `textCount` fields
  - Eliminated client-side count calculation that was prone to filtering errors
- **GraphQL Validation Error**: Fixed query validation failure when requesting media counts
  - Updated `CharacterMediaGallery` to use `limit: 1` instead of `limit: 0` for count queries
  - Maintains efficient count retrieval while satisfying backend validation constraints

#### Component Architecture

- **MediaCard Component**: Updated to use proper `MediaGridItem` type instead of full `Media` type
  - Eliminates unnecessary data fetching for display-only components
  - Improved component performance with minimal required props
- **MediaGrid Component**: Enhanced with proper TypeScript interfaces and error boundary handling
- **CharacterMediaGallery Component**: Refactored filtering logic to use separate queries for display vs. counts

### Changed

#### Media Gallery Behavior

- **Filter Tab Functionality**: Filter tabs now accurately display total counts regardless of active filter
  - "All (5)" tab shows total media count
  - "Images (3)" tab shows total image count even when text filter is active
  - "Text (2)" tab shows total text count even when image filter is active
- **Query Optimization**: Implemented dual-query strategy for character media gallery
  - Main query fetches filtered media for display with specified limit
  - Count query fetches total counts without media type filter for accurate tab labels
  - Reduced client-side computation and improved data consistency

#### Component Props and Interfaces

- **MediaCard Props**: Simplified props interface with strict typing for media item structure
- **MediaGrid Props**: Enhanced with comprehensive prop validation and default value handling
- **CharacterMediaGallery Props**: Updated to support new count field requirements

#### Development Experience

- **Type Safety**: Eliminated type casting and `any` usage throughout media components
- **Code Maintainability**: Improved component interfaces with clear prop definitions and documentation
- **Error Prevention**: Enhanced TypeScript compilation to catch media-related type mismatches at build time

### Technical Debt Reduction

- **Removed Type Assertions**: Eliminated unsafe type casting in favor of proper interface definitions
- **Improved Component Reusability**: MediaGridItem interface allows flexible component usage across different contexts
- **Enhanced Prop Validation**: Added comprehensive TypeScript validation for all media component props

### Performance Improvements

- **Reduced Data Fetching**: MediaGridItem interface fetches only required fields for display components
- **Optimized Query Strategy**: Dual-query approach reduces unnecessary data transfer for count-only requirements
- **Component Rendering**: Improved rendering performance with minimal prop interfaces and reduced re-renders
