## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Database Schema Expansion
- **Community System Entities**:
  - `Community` model for organizing users into distinct communities
  - `Role` model with community-scoped permissions (canCreateSpecies, canCreateCharacter, canEditCharacter, canEditSpecies, canCreateInviteCode, canListInviteCodes, canCreateRole, canEditRole)
  - `CommunityMember` junction table linking users to roles within communities
  - `CommunityInvitation` system for role-based community invitations with accept/decline tracking
  - `InviteCode` model supporting multi-use invite codes with claim limits
- **Species and Trait System**:
  - `Species` model with community ownership and image support flags
  - `Trait` model supporting multiple value types (STRING, TIMESTAMP, INTEGER, ENUM)
  - `EnumValue` model for trait enum options with ordering support
  - `SpeciesVariant` model for species sub-types
  - `TraitListEntry` model defining trait requirements and defaults per species variant
  - `EnumValueSetting` model configuring available enum values per species variant
  - `TraitValueType` enum defining supported trait value types
- **Character System Enhancements**:
  - `CharacterOwnershipChange` entity for tracking character ownership transfers
  - Character model migration from text `species` field to relational `speciesId` and `speciesVariantId`
  - JSON `traitValues` field on Character with GIN index for efficient querying
- **User System Enhancements**:
  - Global permission fields: `canCreateCommunity`, `canListUsers`, `canListInviteCodes`, `canCreateInviteCode`, `canGrantGlobalPermissions`
  - Community relationship fields for membership, invitation, and invite code management
  - Character ownership change tracking relationships

#### GraphQL Schema and Service Layer
- Field resolvers for `MediaConnection` entity adding `imageCount` and `textCount` computed fields
- Prisma JSON types generator integration for proper TypeScript support of JSON fields
- Service layer refactoring to eliminate GraphQL type dependencies
- Field resolver pattern implementation for all entity relationship resolution
- E2E testing agent specification for automated regression testing

#### Database Performance Optimizations
- Parallel database queries in media service for efficient type counting
- GIN index on Character.traitValues for fast JSON field queries
- Unique constraints on community/role relationships to prevent duplicates

### Fixed

#### Media System Issues
- **Media Type Counting Bug (#12)**: Fixed incorrect media type counts in character gallery filter buttons
  - Root cause: Filter counts were calculated from already-filtered results instead of total dataset
  - Solution: Separate GraphQL queries for display filtering vs. total counts, backend field resolvers for efficient counting
  - TypeScript improvements: Replaced `any` types with proper `MediaGridItem` interface using deep Pick types
- **GraphQL Validation Error**: Fixed validation failure when querying media with `limit: 0`
  - Changed minimum limit validation from 1 to allow count-only queries
  - Updated frontend to use `limit: 1` for count queries to satisfy validation
- **Character Media Gallery Filter Visibility**: Filter buttons now remain visible when no content exists for selected filter type

#### Service Layer Architecture
- Decoupled service methods from GraphQL types to improve testability and maintainability
- Moved entity relationship fetching from service layer to GraphQL field resolvers
- Fixed circular dependency issues in service imports

### Changed

#### Breaking Changes
- **Character Species Field**: Removed text `species` field from Character model
  - Existing character species data will be lost during migration
  - Replaced with relational `speciesId` and `speciesVariantId` foreign keys
  - Characters now require species to be defined through Communityâ†’Species relationship

#### Architecture Improvements
- **Service Layer Refactoring**: Complete separation of business logic from GraphQL presentation layer
  - Services now return Prisma entities instead of GraphQL types
  - Entity relationship resolution moved to dedicated field resolvers
  - Improved unit testability by removing GraphQL dependencies from business logic
- **Media Service Optimization**: Implemented parallel database queries for media type counting
  - Single service call now efficiently calculates total, image, and text counts
  - Reduced database round trips from 3 separate queries to 1 parallel execution
- **GraphQL Field Resolution Strategy**: Adopted field resolver pattern for all entity relationships
  - Eliminates N+1 query potential (though dataloader implementation still needed)
  - Provides more granular control over data fetching per GraphQL field
  - Enables better caching strategies at the field level

#### Database Schema Updates
- Enhanced User model with comprehensive permission and relationship fields
- Character model now supports dynamic trait system through JSON field storage
- Added comprehensive foreign key relationships for community hierarchy
- Updated Prisma schema with proper cascade deletion rules for data integrity

### Performance Impact
- **Expected Performance Degradation**: Field resolver pattern may introduce N+1 queries until dataloader patterns are implemented
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Media type counting now uses efficient parallel queries, reducing response time for character gallery pages
- **Database Indexing**: Added GIN index on Character.traitValues for fast JSON queries

### Migration Notes
- Database migration required for schema changes
- Existing character species data will be lost (breaking change)
- Communities and species must be created before characters can reference them
- User permission fields default to false, requiring explicit permission grants

### Development Experience
- Enhanced TypeScript support with Prisma JSON types generator
- Improved error handling and validation in media queries  
- Better separation of concerns between service and presentation layers
- Comprehensive test coverage for new entity relationships

## [v1.1.0] - 2025-08-12

### Added
- Enhanced media service deletion with automatic file cleanup for images
- Support for cleaning up image files from S3, local filesystem, and base64 storage
- Proper error handling for file cleanup operations (non-blocking)

### Fixed
- Media deletion now properly cleans up associated image files
- Image file orphaning when media is deleted

## [v1.0.0] - 2025-01-12

### Added
- Case-insensitive tag matching system with canonical display name preservation
- `displayName` field to Tag model for preserving user-entered tag casing
- Centralized tag creation logic in TagsService with `findOrCreateTags()` method
- Proper case-insensitive tag queries using `mode: 'insensitive'` in database operations

### Fixed
- Character service to properly handle new tag relationship system
- Character creation and update methods to use TagsService for tag operations
- Tag duplicate prevention across different case variations (e.g., "Fantasy", "FANTASY", "fantasy")
- Legacy `tags String[]` field usage in character operations

### Changed
- Tag matching now case-insensitive while preserving canonical display names
