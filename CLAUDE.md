- Commit changes routinely. Especially when finishing a major step or feature. Use succinct commit messages with the standard commit syntax eg feat(index): add new route
- Always use yarn instead of npm
- Always use yarn dlx instead of npx
- To execute commands in subdirectories, use the bash subshell syntax instead of cd'ing into directories
- Every time you run cd, it changes your directory in a stateful way. Ensure you are on top of which directory you are in (note: does not apply to subshell cd's)
- Always update the project status document when your current feature/implementation status changes
- Always update the project plan when new requirements are discovered or requested by the user
- You can always just run `yarn install` from the project root to install dependencies for the entire repository
- This project is  yarn 4 monorepo
- You can execute yarn scripts in a particular package by running `yarn workspace ${PACKAGE_NAME} ${SCRIPT_NAME}` (example: `yarn workspace @thclone/backend build`)
