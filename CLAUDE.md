- Commit changes routinely. Especially when finishing a major step or feature. Use succinct commit messages with the standard commit syntax eg feat(index): add new route
- Always use yarn instead of npm
- Always use yarn dlx instead of npx
- Every time you run cd, it changes your directory in a stateful way. Ensure you are on top of which directory you are in (note: does not apply to subshell cd's)
- Always update the project status document when your current feature/implementation status changes
- Always update the project plan when new requirements are discovered or requested by the user
- You can always just run `yarn install` from the project root to install dependencies for the entire repository
- This project is yarn 4 monorepo
- You can execute yarn scripts in a particular package by running `yarn workspace ${PACKAGE_NAME} ${SCRIPT_NAME}` (example: `yarn workspace @chardb/backend build`)
- You can type check the entire repository by running `yarn type-check` in the root
- Jaeger trace analysis is available at http://localhost:16686
- You may start the servers if they are not running with `yarn dev:agent`
  - Frontend: localhost:3000
- The `gh` cli is configured for github interactions beyond simple `git` cli commands
- Local Development Credentials: test@example.com / test123
- Use the .tmp folder in the package root for temporary files (like image uploads).
- App-specific changes should go in the appropriate CHANGELOG.md. The root-level CHANGELOG.md is for tracking cross-cutting changes and non-app-specific changes (like CI for example)
- PSQL credentials are in the backend .env file
- SQS Queue Consumer: The backend runs an SQS consumer for Discord bot prize distribution. Set AWS_SQS_ENABLED=false in .env to disable it in local development. Queue URL must be configured via AWS_SQS_QUEUE_URL.
